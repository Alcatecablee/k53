# Location Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Default location cleared**: User will set their actual location  
✅ **Smart location detection**: App will automatically detect user's location  
✅ **Application ready**: Location-aware features will work with user's actual location  

## How Location Detection Works

The application now uses a **smart location detection system** that tries multiple sources in order:

### 1. **User Profile** (Highest Priority)
- Checks if user has previously set their location
- Uses saved location from database

### 2. **Local Storage** (Second Priority)
- Checks if location was saved in browser
- Uses previously selected location

### 3. **Auto-Detection** (Third Priority)
- Automatically detects user's current location
- Uses GPS/geolocation services
- Saves detected location to profile and storage

### 4. **Manual Selection** (Fallback)
- If no location is found, user must set it manually
- Available on Profile and Practice pages

## How to Set Your Location

## Why Location Matters

Your location helps the app provide:

- **Regional driving conditions**

3. **Set location manually** through Profile or Practice page

### Auto-detect not working?
1. **Enable location services** on your device
2. **Allow location access** in your browser settings
3. **Try manual selection** instead

### Location not updating?
1. **Sign out and sign back in**
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Check your internet connection**

## Privacy & Security
