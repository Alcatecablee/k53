# Daily Usage Tracking Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The progress display showed inconsistent information:
- **"3 scenarios completed"** (total progress)
- **"Daily scenarios: 0/5 used"** (daily usage)
- **"5 scenarios remaining today"** (calculated from daily usage)

This indicated that while users were completing scenarios and their total progress was being tracked, the daily usage counter was not being incremented.

## Root Cause

The application had **two separate tracking systems** that were not synchronized:

1. **Total Progress Tracking** (`achievementService.ts`):
   - Tracks total scenarios completed across all time
   - Stored in localStorage as `k53_user_progress`
   - Updated via `updateProgress()` function when scenarios are answered

2. **Daily Usage Tracking** (`subscriptionService.ts`):
   - Tracks scenarios used per day for subscription limits
   - Stored in database/localStorage as daily usage records
   - Should be updated via `updateDailyUsage()` function

**The Problem**: `updateDailyUsage()` was never called when scenarios were completed, so the daily usage counter remained at 0 while total progress increased.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `client/pages/Practice.tsx`
**Function**: `handleAnswer()`

### Before:
```typescript
// Update achievement progress
if (testMode === "scenarios" && currentItem) {
  const scenario = currentItem as K53Scenario;
  const oldProgress = getUserProgress();
  const newProgress = updateProgress(
    scenario.category,
    scenario.difficulty,
    isCorrect,
    userLocation?.city
  );
  
  // Check for new achievements and send notifications
  pushNotificationService.checkForNewAchievements(oldProgress, newProgress);
}
```

### After:
```typescript
// Update achievement progress
if (testMode === "scenarios" && currentItem) {
  const scenario = currentItem as K53Scenario;
  const oldProgress = getUserProgress();
  const newProgress = updateProgress(
    scenario.category,
    scenario.difficulty,
    isCorrect,
    userLocation?.city
  );
  
  // Update daily usage for scenarios
  updateDailyUsage("scenarios", 1).then(async (updatedUsage) => {
    if (updatedUsage) {
      // Refresh usage info to update the UI
      try {
        const newAccessInfo = await canAccessScenarios();
        setUsageInfo(newAccessInfo);
      } catch (error) {
        logError("Failed to refresh usage info", error, "handleAnswer");
      }
    }
  }).catch((error) => {
    logError("Failed to update daily usage", error, "handleAnswer");
  });
  
  // Check for new achievements and send notifications
  pushNotificationService.checkForNewAchievements(oldProgress, newProgress);
}
```

## Changes Made

1. **Added daily usage update**: Called `updateDailyUsage("scenarios", 1)` when a scenario is answered
2. **Added UI refresh**: Refreshed the usage info state to update the display immediately
3. **Added error handling**: Proper error handling for both the update and refresh operations

## Expected Result

After this fix:
- When a user completes a scenario, both total progress AND daily usage will be incremented
- The progress display will show consistent information:
  - Total scenarios completed (e.g., "4 scenarios completed")
  - Daily usage (e.g., "Daily scenarios: 1/5 used")
  - Remaining scenarios (e.g., "4 scenarios remaining today")

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Complete a scenario test
2. Check that the daily usage counter increases
3. Verify the progress display shows consistent information
4. Check that the daily limit is properly enforced

## Files Modified

- `client/pages/Practice.tsx` - Added daily usage tracking to scenario completion
- `scripts/debug-daily-usage.js` - Created debugging script for troubleshooting

## Notes

- The fix only affects scenario-based tests, not question-based tests (which are unlimited)
- Daily usage resets each day automatically
- The fix maintains backward compatibility and includes proper error handling
- Both database and localStorage fallback mechanisms are preserved
