With each yard test  man euver we have included  a tabl e that  shows  the numb er of penalty  point s that  
can be allocated fo r any errors  in executing the vario us elements in that man euver , e.g. parallel parkin g
incline start, al ley do ckin g.
 
For examp le if you f orget to do a 360 degree observati on during  a particu lar manu ever which requires 
that  action, you wil l be p enalized  5 points. Similarly, if you do not signa l your  intention  when it is 
needed, that can cost you 5 points. The higher the numb er of penalty points allocat ed to an  action , the 
more  important it is for you t o do  it correct ly.
 A shaded box  indicates an element you must do corr ectly or you will fail the entire test imm ediately.
 Pena lty points are given  for any act ion that:

Use of the brakes:
Parking brake: known  as t he handbrake or a device us ed in  the ordinary cours e of events to ke ep a

Braking: : the act of causing a v ehicle to reduce speed by application of the service brake .
  The ratch et release mechanism must be press ed in wh en applying the parkin g brak e and released 
   when the brak e is holding .
 The parki ng break must be ap plied wh en the vehicle is parked or stopped for any l ength of time, 
   or where there is a possibility of rolling.
 The parki ng break should no t be applied while the veh icle is in mot ion except  in the case of a

 To test that the vehicle will remain stationary,  the footbrake sh ould be rel eased  slowly af ter th e

  The service/ footbrake should be appl ied timeously, smoothly an d pro gressive ly using the right

   under control
 Where possible, braki ng should be appli ed on a st raight cours e

K53 DRI VERS LICEN SE THE K53: ACTIONS EXPLAINED
Observe 360 degree:
Look  for hazards  in all directions, to mak e sure that you can keep a s afe space around your  vehicle 
and not endang er other road users when you make a man euver. To do  this you must look ahead 
and also to both  sides, use rear-view mi rrors to look to  the rear,  and also look over your should er(s) 
to check in the blin d spo ts (tho se areas  not visible in the rear-v iew mirrors )
 Check the mirrors:
look  in all the rear -view mi rrors (the interio r mirro rs and also any exterio r mirro rs) to see whet her 
there are any ve hicles behind you that could c ause a dan ger if  you were  to execute the maneuv er.
 Check blind spot(s):
Check the areas not visible in the mi rrors (called bli nd spo ts) to see if there is a potential hazard  
behind  your ve hicle. In some maneuvers the in structio n will be to check the blind spots, here you  
will need to check in both b lind spots, to the left a nd also to the ri ght. In other maneuvers it is onl y 
necessary to check on the side to which a h azard may be po ssible. In these maneuvers the 
instruction s on the text  box will spec ify which b lind spot to check. Your w heels should always be  
straig ht when you ch eck the blind spot.
 Signal:
After ensuring that it will be safe to exec ute the maneuv er, use the indicator to signal your 
intention be fore changing lan es or di rect ion, and bef ore turning. If you intend on slowin g down  by 
braking,  your brake lights w ill serve as  the indication to motorist behin d you. If you are travelling 
the attenti on of the driver behind yo u to the fact that you are s lowing down or stopping.
 Cancel signal:
Always  make sure that the signal has automati cally cancelled af ter turning, if not, cancel it your self. 
It is usually necessary to cance l the signal manually aft er ch anging lanes . Cance lling a signal is 
extremely importan t, as a signal wron gly operating can  confuse other road users and cause  a 
collision  or fatality.
 Select gear:
Select an ap propri ate gear for the speed yo u are t ravel ling, or to ass ist in controlling the speed of 
the vehicle. In some maneuver  the part icular gear t o be sel ected is mentioned, e.g. 1st gear, reverse 
gear.
