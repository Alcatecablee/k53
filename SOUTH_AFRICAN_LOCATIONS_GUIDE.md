## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive information on using proper South African suburb names and locations in K53 scenarios. Instead of generic city names, scenarios should reference specific suburbs, landmarks, and areas to make them more realistic and relatable to South African drivers.

### Key Benefits
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Drivers can relate to specific areas they know
- **Better Learning**: Context-specific situations improve retention
- **Geographic Diversity**: Covers various driving environments
- **Cultural Relevance**: Reflects actual South African driving conditions

---

## Why Use Suburb Names

### Current Issue
Most scenarios currently use only city names:
- ❌ "You're driving in Johannesburg..."
- ❌ "You're driving in Cape Town..."
- ❌ "You're driving in Pretoria..."

### Better Approach
Use specific suburb names:
- ✅ "You're driving in Sandton, Johannesburg..."
- ✅ "You're driving in Sea Point, Cape Town..."
- ✅ "You're driving in Brooklyn, Pretoria..."

### Benefits
1. **Realistic Context**: Drivers know these areas and their characteristics
2. **Traffic Patterns**: Different suburbs have different traffic conditions
3. **Road Types**: Suburbs have varying road layouts and conditions
4. **Safety Considerations**: Each area has unique safety challenges

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Update Existing Scenarios
When updating existing scenarios, replace generic city references with specific suburbs:

**Before:**
```javascript
location: {
  specificity: "city",
  region: "Gauteng",
  city: "Johannesburg"
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
location: {
  specificity: "suburb",
  region: "Gauteng",
  city: "Johannesburg",
  suburb: "Sandton",
  area: "Sandton CBD"
}
```

### 2. New Scenario Development
When creating new scenarios:
1. **Choose appropriate suburb** based on scenario requirements
2. **Research area characteristics** (traffic patterns, road types, safety considerations)
3. **Match scenario context** to suburb characteristics
4. **Use specific landmarks** when relevant
5. **Consider time and weather** appropriate for the area

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Verify suburb names** are spelled correctly
- **Confirm area characteristics** match scenario requirements
- **Check traffic patterns** are realistic for the area
- **Ensure safety considerations** are appropriate for the location

### 4. Geographic Distribution
Aim for balanced geographic coverage:
- **Major cities**: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Pretoria
- **Suburban diversity**: Business, residential, student, industrial areas
- **Regional coverage**: Include other major cities
- **Rural areas**: Include rural and semi-rural locations

## Summary

Using proper suburb names in K53 scenarios provides:

1. **Realistic Context**: Drivers can relate to specific areas they know
2. **Better Learning**: Context-specific situations improve retention
3. **Geographic Diversity**: Covers various driving environments
4. **Cultural Relevance**: Reflects actual South African driving conditions
5. **Enhanced Engagement**: More relatable scenarios increase user engagement

### Next Steps
1. **Update existing scenarios** to use specific suburb names
2. **Create new scenarios** using the enhanced location structure
3. **Research area characteristics** for accurate scenario development
4. **Maintain geographic balance** across all scenario categories
