# Environment Configuration Fixes

## Problem

The application was crashing with the error:

```
Error: Environment configuration is incomplete
    at getEnvironmentConfig (client/lib/env.ts:15:15)
```

## Root Cause

Multiple files were throwing errors when environment variables were missing, causing the entire application to crash instead of gracefully handling missing configuration.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **client/lib/env.ts** - Complete Rewrite

- ❌ **Before**: Threw errors for missing environment variables
- ✅ **After**: Returns nullable values and warns instead of throwing
- ✅ **Added**: `isConfigured` flag to check if environment is complete
- ✅ **Added**: Graceful fallbacks and demo mode support

### 2. **client/lib/supabaseWrapper.ts** - Conditional Client Creation

- ❌ **Before**: Always tried to create Supabase client even with null values
- ✅ **After**: Only creates client when credentials are available
- ✅ **Added**: Null checks and "demo mode" messaging

### 3. **client/config/index.ts** - Non-blocking Validation

- ❌ **Before**: `console.error` for missing config (could cause issues)
- ✅ **After**: `console.warn` with demo mode message

### 4. **database/setup-db.ts** - Graceful Exit

- ❌ **Before**: `process.exit(1)` (error exit) for missing variables
- ✅ **After**: `process.exit(0)` (graceful exit) with warning message

### 5. **database/migrate-scenarios.ts** - Environment Variable Names

- ❌ **Before**: Used `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (wrong variable name)
- ✅ **After**: Uses `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (correct variable name)
- ✅ **Added**: Graceful exit for missing variables

### 6. **client/components/DemoModeIndicator.tsx** - User Communication

- ✅ **Added**: Visual indicator when app is running in demo mode
- ✅ **Added**: Clear explanation of limitations
- ✅ **Added**: Link to setup documentation

### 7. **client/lib/envDebug.ts** - Development Debugging

- ✅ **Added**: Environment debugging utility
- ✅ **Added**: Automatic debug logging in development mode

## Result

The application now:

- ✅ **Never crashes** due to missing environment variables
- ✅ **Runs in demo mode** when configuration is incomplete
- ✅ **Shows clear warnings** instead of throwing errors
- ✅ **Provides helpful guidance** for users to set up the environment
- ✅ **Maintains full functionality** using local data when database is unavailable

## Environment States

### Demo Mode (No Environment Variables)

- Supabase: Not connected
- Authentication: Disabled
- Database: Local fallbacks
- Progress: Browser storage only
- User Experience: Full functionality with limitations noted

### Configured Mode (Environment Variables Present)

- Supabase: Connected
- Authentication: Enabled
- Database: Full persistence
- Progress: Saved to database
- User Experience: Complete functionality

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Demo Mode Test**: Deploy without environment variables

   - Should show demo mode indicator
   - Should not crash
   - Should allow full use of questions/scenarios

2. **Configured Mode Test**: Add environment variables
   - Should connect to Supabase
   - Should enable authentication
   - Should hide demo mode indicator

## Debug Information

In development, the console will show:

```
=== Environment Debug Info ===
Node Environment: development
Is Development: true
Is Production: false
Is Configured: false
Supabase URL Present: false
Supabase Key Present: false
API URL: http://localhost:8080/api
Environment Status: { isValid: false, environment: 'development', ... }
Is Valid: false
==============================
```

This helps developers quickly understand the current environment state.
