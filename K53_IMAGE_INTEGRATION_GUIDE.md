## Enhanced Image Selection Logic

The application now uses intelligent image selection:

### For Questions
- **Context-Aware**: Images are selected based on question content
- **Category-Specific**: Different images for controls, signs, and rules
- **Difficulty-Based**: Basic, intermediate, and advanced images

### For Scenarios
- **Location-Aware**: Images match scenario location (Johannesburg, Cape Town, etc.)
- **Context-Specific**: Urban, rural, highway, weather conditions
- **Difficulty-Based**: Matches scenario difficulty level

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Source Images
1. **Official Sources**: Obtain images from K53 official documentation
2. **Driving Schools**: Partner with local driving schools for authentic images
3. **Traffic Authorities**: Contact local traffic authorities for sign images
4. **Photography**: Take photos of local traffic situations (with proper permissions)

### Step 2: Process Images
1. **Resize**: Ensure all images meet quality guidelines
2. **Optimize**: Compress images to meet file size requirements
3. **Organize**: Place images in appropriate category directories
4. **Validate**: Test image display in the application

### Step 3: Update Image Mapping
1. **Add Entries**: Update `client/data/imageMapping.ts` with new images
2. **Add Context**: Include relevant context and difficulty information
3. **Test Selection**: Verify image selection logic works correctly

### Step 4: Test Integration
1. **Display Test**: Verify images display correctly in practice questions
2. **Scenario Test**: Test scenario-specific image selection
3. **Performance Test**: Ensure images load quickly and don't impact performance
